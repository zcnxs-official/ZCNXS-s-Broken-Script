# ‚öôÔ∏è Modified Script by zcnxs

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my custom Roblox script, based on the infamous "**Zack's Modified Broken**" script. This is **not just a reupload** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete overhaul with stability fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and continued support.

This repository was created by **[zcnxs](https://github.com/zcnxs-official)** to preserve, improve, and extend the functionality of a script that many in the community have used, modified, or learned from.
